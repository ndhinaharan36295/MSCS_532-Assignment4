# Assignment 4: Heap Data Structures – Implementation, Analysis, and Applications

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and analysis of two key applications of heap data structures:

1. **Heapsort** – An efficient in-place sorting algorithm using a max-heap.
2. **Priority Queue** – A min-heap-based priority queue supporting task scheduling with dynamic priorities.

The code is written in Python and includes detailed performance analysis, theoretical complexity discussion, and simulation-ready components.

## Contents

- `heap_sort.py` – Heapsort algorithm using a max-heap (1-based indexing, CLRS style).
- `priority_queue.py` – Min-heap-based priority queue with `insert`, `extract_min`, and `decrease_key`.
- `empirical_analysis.py` – Script comparing Heapsort with quicksort & mergesort algos.
